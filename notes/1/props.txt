passing some variables into the component

const Greet = props => {
    ...
}

to display a property:
{props.name}

-> props.name is what <HTML name:""> tag has.

the content in between the opening
and closing brackets </> will be the {children} prop.

App.js -> displayer
Component.js -> template

Class components can have this.props.xxx inside a component

strict rule:
values immutable, cannot be changed.
