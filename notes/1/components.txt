Functional Component
props -> function -> HTML (JSX)

accepts properties, returns HTMl as an UI component.

1. (ALWAYS)import React from 'react'
2. return a component
3. export the component

in the App file:
1. import the component
2. display it as a HTML tag with the name

convention:
writing using arrow functions

const NAME = () => COMPONENT

note:
the default export allows us to customize the component
name to anything.

if used export in 1 go in the function, 
it will be NAMED, the names must be the same AND in {curly braces}.

for most cases, use default exports.
