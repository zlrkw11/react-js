React events are named with camelCase
like: onClick()

passing a function as an event handler
onClick = {clickHandler} for example

IMPORTANT:
pass the function as event handler (without parenthesis), not a function call like clickHandler().
gets worse in class components. 

for class components, it is just this.clickHandler. Similar usage.
