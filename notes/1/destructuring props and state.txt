props
method 1:
destructure in the function parameter itself
props is replaced by name and children as they are selected / taken out
export const component = ({name, children}) => { ... {name} {children} }

method 2:
in class components, destructure in render()
class component extends Component {
  render() {
    const { x, y } = this.props;
  }
}

after destructuring, we can use the destructured names instead of
props.x or this.props.x.

states:
const {state1, state2} = this.state;
