if we set the state directly without using setState,
the counter will change and increment, but the UI won't render.

MUST use setState at all times as long as there is a state change.
increment() {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
}

the new object passing in would be this.state.count++ to override the count.

note: this.increment(), always use this.function() inside the component. 

callback function* (records on time as setState operates)

> passing a function as a state, not an object
> (prevState)=>({}), for prevState values as arguments
